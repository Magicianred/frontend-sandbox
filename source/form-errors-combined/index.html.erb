<h1>Form errors - one message for a group of inputs</h1>

<h2>Question</h2>
<p>We want to alert users to errors in a <strong>related group of inputs</strong> eg. 3 select boxes for Date of Birth, where a <strong>single error message</strong> is used for the group, rather than individual messages for each select box.</p>

<p><a href="form-errors-combined-message.html">Sample markup</a></p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>Approved by Gavin Evans, 13/3/14</p>
<p>Feedback:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We have checked with various AT including Jaws 13 in IE9, Jaws 14 in IE10 and NVDA in Firefox 27.01.</p>
<p>This conveys information very well to all users in and out of context as well as a user tabbing through the page.</p>
